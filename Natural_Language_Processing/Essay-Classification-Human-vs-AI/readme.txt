LLM Detect AI Generated Essay: 
----------------------------------------------------------
(Jupyter Notebook is to be run sequentially)


Kaggle Competition Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text

Dataset:The competition dataset comprises about 10,000 essays, some written by students and some generated by a variety of large language models (LLMs). The dataset contains actual text and generated by AI field: 0(student) / 1(LLM)

Goal: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM

Tasks performed: 

1. Analysing the Data:
   - Remove punctuations
   - Analysing and comparing the length of essays 
   - Analysis of most common words by student and LLM
   
2. Pre-processing the Data:
    - Removing Duplicate records
    - Creating a vocabulary index: Using the TextVectorization, we consider the top 30,000 words.
    
3. Embedding and Modelling:
    - Used pre-trained GLOVE Embeddings
    - Created the Embedding Matrix and Embedding Layer
    
4. Modelling: Bi-Directional LSTM
    Model Summary:
    - input_1 (InputLayer)     
    - embedding_1 (Embedding)
    - bidirectional (Bidirectional LSTM Layer)                                                             
    - dense (Dense)    
    - dense_1 (Dense)  
    - dropout (Dropout)       
    - dense_2 (Dense) 
    
4. Evaluation:
   - Validation Accuracy: 98.41%
   - Kaggle Submission Accuracy: 80.9%
