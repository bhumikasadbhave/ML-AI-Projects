This repository includes the projects completed by me as during my Masters in Artificial Intelligence at The Technical University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt.
All the project folders include their own readme files to explain the goal, and how it has been achieved. It also includes some guidelines on how to reproduce the results.

List of fully completed projects:

-> Machine Learning:

    - Protein Sequence Clustering using Affinity Propagation
    - Skeleton Movement (Temporal Data) Classification
    
-> Deep Learning:

    - Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification
    - RESNet Implementation for Image Classification

-> Natural Language Processing:

    - Markov Chain Models for Text Generation
    - Movie Genre Classifier using Data Augmentaiton, GLoVe Embeddings and Bi-Directional LSTM
    - Detecting AI Generated Essays using Data Augmentation and LSTM

-> Reinforcement Learning:

    - Particle and Kalman Filter Implementation for Ball Throwing 



On-going projects:
- VAE Implementation
- BlackJack Implementation
