This repository includes the projects completed by me as during my Masters in Artificial Intelligence at The Technical University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt.
All the project folders include their own readme files to explain the goal, and how it has been achieved. It also includes some guidelines on how to reproduce the results.
